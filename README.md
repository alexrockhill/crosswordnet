This neural-architecture-inspired crossword solver allows you and your large computer with several days on it's hands to solve a crossword that is completely computer generated. If you wanted to you could make your own dictionary for it to solve from but that would probably take you quite some time. I have plans to do that when I get the time with the words of the late, great David Foster Wallace.
